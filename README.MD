#Pokemon Snap - Browser Edition

##MVP:
- Random pokemon is generated, at a pseudo-random time, disapears after a certain amount of time.
- User clicks on the pokemon and pokemon is added to their list of pokemon that they snapped.
- Other users can see wich pokemon they have snapped.
- Activity feed, users can see real-time when someone snaps a pokemon


##Nice to have, from most important to least important:

###Pokemon rarity
- Pokemon sorted by rarity, from least to most rare: common, uncommon, rare and legendary.
- Pokemon appear depending on their rarity. 

### Locations
- Locations, different location have different pokemon
- Location activity, see the amount of users currently in the location
- Pokemon can only be snapped by X amount of people in the location or until time runs out

###Canvas export
- When user snaps a pokemon, the part of the canvas wich holds the pokemon is saved
- This photo is added to the users profile and can be seen by others
- Users can set a photo as their favorite photo

### User Levels
- User gains exp if they snap a new pokemon
- Cetrain location can only be accessed by people of a certain level
- Users levels unlock new pokemon in old locations

###Items
- Users can randomly find pokedollars to buy items with, ie:
- Repels: make common pokemon appear less often
- Amulet Coin: boots pokedollars user finds


###Companion Pokemon
- User can choose to catch one Pokemon they see, non-legendary
- Pokemon gives a boost to the user, ie. Mudkip gives a boost to water pokemon appearing, Meowth makes pokedollars more likely to appear
- Display companion pokemon on user profile

###Traveling (Leander)
- Going to a new location takes time (30 seconds?)
- Traveling faster costs money

###Bribing users
- More users in a location means less uncommon, rare and legendary pokemon appear, because they're shy
- User can choose to send money to other users, asking them to leave the location for a certain amount of time
